# TGPRfSRDCF
Raw result files of our TPAMI paper "Tracking-by-Fusion via Gaussian Process Regression Extended to Transfer Learning" [1]

The zip file includes the raw results for the following four datasets:

- OTB-2015 [3] (which also includes OTB-2013 [4])
- Temple-Color [5]
- VOT2015 [6]
- VOT2016 [7]

These raw results used in the paper [1] are included for both the TGPRfSRDCF and TGPR HOG trackers. The latter is the HOG version of our ECCV2014 work [2].
